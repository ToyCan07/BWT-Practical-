    <h1 align="center">About Computer</h1>
    <p align="center">a programmable electronic device that takes data as input, processes it using
       a CPU according to software instructions, and produces output and stores 
       information. It consists of physical components called hardware (like keyboards,
       monitors, and the central processing unit) and non-physical components like programs
       and data known as software.a Computers perform various tasks by executing programs,
       ranging from mathematical calculations to manipulating complex data like photos,
       videos, and text documents.
    <h1 align="left" >about CPU</h1> 
    <p align="left">A CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the "brain" of a computer, a small
       chip on the motherboard that performs calculations and executes instructions for
       programs and applications. It acts as the primary engine, taking data and
       instructions from storage, performing arithmetic and logic operations, and
       transforming input into usable output, thereby managing the operating system,
       handling multitasking, and enabling all computing functions.</p>
    <h1 align="right">about hardware</h1>
    <P align="right">Hardware refers to the physical, tangible components of an electronic
       device, like a computer, that can be seen and touched. These parts include the
       central processing unit (CPU), memory, hard drives, monitors, keyboards, and other
       peripheral devices, all of which work together to enable the system's function.</P>
